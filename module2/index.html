                    I dance because thereâ€™s no greater feeling in the world than moving a piece of music and letting the rest of the world disappear.Some people dream of success while others wake up and work hard at it.It never gets easier. It just gets better.

                    The emotions caused by music, the attitudes of its composers and players, and the venues it is played can also vary from time to time and place to place. The music one person loves might be painful for another to listen to, and vice versa!

                    An athlete cannot run with money in his pockets. He must run with hope in his heart and dreams in his head.Never give up, never give in.
